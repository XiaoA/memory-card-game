## Memory Card Game

The rules are simple. Pick a card, and then pick it's match. If you match two cards, they'll stay face up. If not, they'll be placed face down again. Try to remember where the cards are. To win, you must find all the matches.

I have a lot of enhancements I'd like to make later; it's fairly simple, but it was fun using vanilla JS to manipulate the DOM.
